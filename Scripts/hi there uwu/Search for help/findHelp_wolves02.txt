I'm hiding behind a tree right now
I think there's like a cabin behind the wolves
I need to get there but there's a lot of wolves
Like a crazy amount
The light to the cabin is on as well someone might be inside!
Shit wtf do I do?

$ if || string || hasKnife || false
$ choice
It's not worth getting attacked by a wolf, quietly walk away from them || findHelp_avoidWolves
Just run past them into the cabin, really fast though || findHelp_runWolves
$ endchoice
$ endif

$ if || string || hasKnife || true
$ choice
It's not worth getting attacked by a wolf, quietly walk away from them || findHelp_avoidWolves
You have a knife, attack the wolves and get to the cabin || findHelp_attackWolves
$ endchoice
$ endif
