Holy shit {name}.
I trust you.
I trust you so much.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Just... give me a minute...
$ wait || 2
Okay, here goes nothing.
$ wait || 3
Okay, I think it's done.
I can't really see the body anymore...
Shit I feel sick.
Why did I just do that?
Why did I just listen to you?
This is your fault, I'm going.
Good night.
