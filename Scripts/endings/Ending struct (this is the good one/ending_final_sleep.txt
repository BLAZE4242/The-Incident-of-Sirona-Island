You haven't heard from Alex in a while.

After that, you get a letter from Alex in the mail.
$ notype
Alex Writes how he's doing fine, when he shot the flare gun some local hunters located and took him to their house outside of the woods.
$ notype
The hunters went the next morning out again to look for what Alex hit, and found an unconscious man.
$ notype
Knowing Alex would be arrested for this, the hunters resuscitated the man and told him he had just fallen pretty bad.
$ notype
They let the man back into society as he was no longer a threat to Alex getting arrested.
$ notype
Alex now lives with the hunters, fearing that if he goes back on the grid, he will be suspected and arrested.
$ notype
Alex wishes you well and requests for you to burn the letter and all evidence it was sent to you.
