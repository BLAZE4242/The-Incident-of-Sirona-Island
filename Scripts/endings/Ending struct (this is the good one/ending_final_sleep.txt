You haven't heard from Alex in a while.
$ notype
After that, you get a letter from Alex in the mail.
$ notype
Alex Writes how he's doing fine, when he shot the flare gun some local hunters located and took him to their house outside of the woods.
$ notype
The hunters went the next morning out again to look for what Alex hit, and found an unconscious man.

Knowing Alex would be arrested for this, the hunters resuscitated the man and told him he had just fallen pretty bad.
