HOLY SHIT! YOU ACTUALLY DID IT!

YOU WAKE UP AND REALISE IT WAS ALL JUST A DREAM! ALEX NEVER HIT ANYONE WITH HIS CAR, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A FRIEND CALLED ALEX! ALEX ISN'T REAL!

ENDING 19/19
THE BEST ENDING!!!!

YOU ALSO EARN A VERY SPECICIAL PLACE IN MY HEART IF YOU GET THIS ENDING, I LOVE YOU!
Unless someone told you it was here, that's cheating then.
I don't love you if you did that, in fact I specifically hate you if you did.

If you did find this by yourself though, I'll be waiting for you, in heaven when you die.
There's already a spot reserved just for you... I'll be waiting :')
